!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    This chapter introduces the basic theoretical building blocks for learning AI ethics. We start with a brief metaethical motivation, looking at different positions in metaethics and reflecting on how these affect the way we do practical ethics.
    Additionally, we will delve into the some of the main normative theories in practical ethics: consequentialist theories, deontological theories, virtue ethics, and biocentric ethics. These concepts will be useful to paint the ethical landscape against which the sub-field of AI (practical) ethics has developed.
