## Chapter Outline

- [Stakeholder Engagement Process](engagement.md)
- [Stakeholder Impact Assessment](impact.md)


!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    In this chapter we look at the importance of stakeholders in sustainability through what is known as the stakeholder engagement processes (SEP) as well as the stakeholder impact asssessment (SIA). The former is a three-staged process with the following core steps: (i) stakeholder analysis and salience, (ii) positionality reflection, and (iii) stakeholder engagement objective and method selection. 

    The latter goes beyond the SEP and is designed to ensure a project can not only remain sustainable, but also support the sustainability of impacted communities throughout time. Beyond development and initial deployment, an AI system requires continuous monitoring to ensure that the long-term transformative effects and impacts of the project are not only well-understood, but accepted and beneficial for impacted individuals and communities.
