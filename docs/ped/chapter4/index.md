## Introduction

This chapter builds on the guidance for planning and facilitating different types of public engagement by delving deeper into some of the practical tools and methods.

In the first section we look at the communication of data science and AI as a process of storytelling.
This includes a brief look at data visualisation tools; the need to consider the limits of your audience's attention; and the importance of narrative structure. 

In the second section we consider the challenge of communicating uncertainty.
Science and technology communication often requires the communication of probabilistic information, statistics, and risky or uncertain outcomes.
There are a range of challenges associated with this form of communication when it comes to public engagement.
Therefore, we take some time to identify what these challenges are, and what we can do to overcome them.
