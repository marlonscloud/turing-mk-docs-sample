# Activity 1: Exploring Historical Case Studies

In one respect, our first activity is a simple one.

In groups you will discuss your thoughts and answers to the following questions.
In doing so, however, you will probably encounter some difficulties in forming a consensus on your answers.
This is to be expected, and you should also pay careful attention to the reasons why you differ in your opinions or beliefs.

!!! activity "Questions for Reflection"

    1. Which properties of these case studies do you think make them examples of unethical or (ir)responsible research and innovation?
    2. Are any of these properties necessary or sufficient for categorising a research or innovation project as unethical?
    3. Can you think of any other famous cases of (ir)responsible research or innovation?
    4. What about cases of responsible research and innovation?
    5. What properties differentiate the (ir)responsible cases from the responsible cases of research or innovation?
