# Activity 3: Specifying Principles

Now that you have taken a look at the [SAFE-D principles](responsible_ds.md) for responsible data science, it is time to think about making them more specific.
Don't worry, we will cover this in a later chapter, but it's also helpful to reflect on your initial thoughts and perspectives.

This task is another simple one that revolves around group discussion.
For each of the SAFE-D principles, you will need to consider and devise a short sentence that captures the substance of the principle.
For instance, if one of the principles was 'Autonomy' a short sentence could be as follows:

!!! quote

    All algorithmic systems that interact with humans should be designed to support and promote human autonomy and self-determination. They should not coerce, deceive, or otherwise use manipulative nudges that are intended to shape user behaviour in a non-transparent or non-deliberative manner.

!!! note Summary

    If you are following this guide as part of an instructor-led course, you will be given a link to a HackMD document where you can draft the statements for each of the SAFE-D principles. Otherwise, you can use any text editor.
