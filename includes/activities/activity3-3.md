# Activity 5: Bias Cards

This activity will introduce you to 9 key biases that can affect the processes and outcomes of a project lifecycle.

You will look at 3 social biases, 3 statistical biases, and 3 cognitive biases, and then attempt to map them to key stages of the project lifecycle based on where you think they will have the biggest impact.

- On [this page](https://bit.ly/3phlmw3) you will find a set of interactive cards that provide you with some information about each of these biases.

Start by selecting one from each category and then trying to place it at a stage in the [project lifecycle](project_lifecycle.md) where you think it will have a noticeable or significant impact, and where you could also take action to mitigate its effects.

There are two caveats here:

1. You may find that a bias is relevant for multiple stages. This should be expected. However, if so, place it at the highest point upstream that you believe it is best to consider. Don't be tempted to just place them all at the project planning stage though. While it is good to anticipate bias at the earliest possible opportunity, it is also important to ensure that reflection and action is properly contextualised.
2. You have not yet looked at each of the activities for the project lifecycle in detail, so your understanding of the different activities will be limited. This is intentional. After covering the material in [Chapter 3](../chapter3/index.md), you will return to this activity and have the opportunity to see whether your initial answers should be changed.

!!! note "Mural"

    If you are doing this as part of an instructor-led version of the course, you will be given a specific link to an interactive Mural board to support this activity. Otherwise, feel free to use the following template to create your own.

Activity 4: Bias Cards

This activity introduces 9 key biases (3 for each of the different types), and explores which of the stages and activities for the project lifecycle is most impacted by their effects.
