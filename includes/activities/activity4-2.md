# Activity 7: Developing Case Studies

In this activity we will further develop the case studies that were selected for the previous activity.

Having now looked at the first three stages of the project lifecycle, you will go back through them and reflect on the types of activities you would have carried out had you been undertaking this project.
As a reminder, here are the three stages and some of the challenges that could arise at each stage:

- Project Planning
  - Is the technology or model you are considering the right one for the problem that has been identified?
  - Have you discussed the project with an *ethics committee* or *internal review board* to help evaluate the project's objectives and processes?
  - Have you anticipated possible challenges that could arise in the future stages of the project lifecycle (e.g. sufficient funding or resources to ensure adequate user training)?
  - Have you conducted a risk or impact assessment that provides a comprehensive overview of the target domain and a contextual evaluation of possible harms such as discrimination or privacy violations?
- Problem Formulation
  - Have you engaged affected stakeholders or users to ensure that their needs and challenges are well reflected in the problem formulation?
  - Does the manner in which you have formulated the problem statement reflect certain biases inherent to your teams specific standpoint?
  - Do any of the input or output variables pose unacceptable risk of representational harm to marginalised or vulnerable groups?
- Data Extraction or Procurement
  - Where has your data been obtained from?
  - If it has been procured, do you have sufficient transparency and information about its provenance to ensure you are able to carry out the necessary forms of due diligence and responsibility?
  - Have the data subjects been engaged and participated in the data collection, including being presented with an adequate explanation of the purpose for its collection and processes by which the data will be stored and processed (e.g. kept secure)?

These are just illustrative deliberative prompts.
In groups, you will now go back through these stages and discuss possible challenges, and how your project team would propose to handle them, were you carrying out the project for real.
When you do this, you will likely encounter some gaps in the case study information.
It is up to your group to decide how to fill in these gaps.
For example, you may want to pretend that your project team acquire or procure additional data, and then add an option to the 'Data Types' section of your case study.

Be creative with this, and don't shy away from making some controversial choices that could pose challenges down the line.
This is a good opportunity to reflect on how certain choices may lead to desirable or undesirable consequences, without the risk of actually harming people in real life.

Once you've made your choices, be sure to update your collaborative document, as this information will be relevant for later activities.
