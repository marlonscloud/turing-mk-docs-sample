# Activity 8: Identifying Missing Data

This activity builds upon [Activity 7](activity4-2.md) by focusing on the specific issue of 'missing data bias'.
You have already encountered this bias a couple of times, both in the '[Bias Cards](../../chapter3/activity3-3.md)' activity, and also in the data analysis section just covered.
Using these two resources as reference, in this activity you will try to identify possible sources of missing data in your case studies, and then discuss how the absence of this data could affect your own exploratory data analysis, if you were carrying out the actual steps.

However, unlike [Activity 7](activity4-2.md) this activity only requires discussion (or, critical reflection if you are carrying it out on your own).
Nevertheless, we can go about this in a structured manner by asking the following questions:

1. Think about possible stakeholder groups that are not currently included or well-represented in your project? Perhaps there is a persona that you did not use in [activity 6](activity4-1.md) that you could reuse. Could this group or persona be a source of missing data for your project? If so, what issues could arise as a result of the absence of this data?
2. At which stage of 'exploratory data analysis' would you be able to identify this absence (if at all)? Could something have been done earlier in the project lifecycle to prevent this from occuring?
3. Are there identifiable reasons for why the data is missing? If so, is it right to gather the data? Is it possible that doing so would violate a stakeholders right to privacy?
4. If you cannot gather the data, are there any imputation methods that you could use to mitigate the impact of the missing data bias?

You do not need to note your answers on your case study, but you may wish to add details of the missing data sources.
