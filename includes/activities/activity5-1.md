# Activity 10: Building an Assurance Case

At the start of Chapter 4 we introduced the [case studies](../chapter4/case_studies.md) that you will have been developing over the course of the last several activities.
In this final activity, you will build a hypothetical assurance case for this project based on your expectations of the goals, properties, and evidence that ought to be demonstrated and communicated.
As with the previous activities, this will involve some speculation.
It's important to remember that the aim here is to familiarise yourself with the reflective and deliberative procedure, rather than worrying too much about the specific details.

    If you are doing this as part of an instructor-led version of the course, you will be given a specific link to an interactive Mural board to support this activity. Otherwise, feel free to use the following template to create your own.

## Steps for Building an Assurance Case

To build an assurance case for your project, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Decide on *one* goal that is important to your project. In reality, several goals may be important, but we'll just focus on one.
2. Consider the attributes of this goal for which you will need to develop corresponding system or project property claims.
3. Use the project lifecycle as a reflective guide to help you identify the relevant claims.
4. Identify the type of evidential artefact that would need to be documented to support the set of claims. 
5. Determine if your evidence base is completed and sufficient.
6. Evaluate the overall strength and justifiability of your argument.

## Critically Evaluating your Assurance Case

Once you have your draft assurance case ready, the next stage is to adopt the position of one of your project's stakeholders (or stakeholder group) or affected users and to critically evaluate the overall argument.
Now, ask yourself:

- How is the goal important to this stakeholder? If it's not, for the purpose of this activity choose another stakeholder.
- Would the stakeholder agree with the attributes that the assurance case focuses on in developing the relevant claims?
- Is the language used throughout accessible to and interpretable by the stakeholder?
- Has enough information been provided in a transparent manner?
- Is the evidence given likely to be accepted by the stakeholder, given the claim to which it is linked?

## Revising the Assurance Case

If any of the questions in the previous section reveal gaps or improvements for your assurance case, then go back and adjust the case as necessary.
If you complete this exercise in good time, feel free to choose another goal and repeat the process.
