<h1 id="when-should-you-engage">When should you engage?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-should-you-engage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>A complete answer to the question of <em>when</em> you should engage will, ultimately, depend on the specific details of your project.
For instance, if your project involves the collection of experimental data from research subjects, then a significant part of the engagement will likely happen early on in your projects lifecycle.
In contrast, if your project only requires communication of results and findings (e.g., for the goal of increased public awareness), then engagement may happen towards the end.
The goal in this chapter is not to provide an exhaustive list or flowchart that can help you answer the question for any project—this would not be feasible.
Instead, what we will be exploring are two frameworks that can help you answer this question through a series of deliberative processes.</p>
<p>The first of these frameworks is based on a model of a typical ML/AI project lifecycle.
Although most relevant in the context of innovation projects, it can also play a valuable role in research projects, such as those that use ML to support data science.</p>
<h2 id="the-mlai-project-lifecycle">The ML/AI Project Lifecycle<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mlai-project-lifecycle" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A significant portion of modern AI methods are data-driven and rely on various types of machine learning to identify patterns in the data and construct predictive models that can classify, forecast, or optimise goals (among other things).<sup id="fnref:symbolic"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:symbolic">1</a></sup>
As such, data science projects are increasingly turning to machine learning algorithms to help generate knowledge or support scientific processes of discovery (e.g., drug discovery).</p>
<p>Although a wide range of differences exist between research and innovation projects, the following model is a useful abstraction for reflecting on the typical activities associated with the lifecycle of a project that involves some form of ML or AI.</p>
<p><img align="center" alt="A graphical representation of a typical ML/AI project lifecycle." src="../../../assets/images/graphics/project-lifecycle.png" /></p>
<p>As the above figure demonstrates, we can split a typical project into three over-arching stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Project Design</li>
<li>Model Development</li>
<li>System Deployment</li>
</ol>
<p>'Project Design' comprises those activities that set the foundation for the practical development of the model (e.g., desk-based research, experimental design, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis).</p>
<p>'Model Development' captures the technical processes of building a predictive model, as well as the important process of documenting how it was developed. This is not just important for the reproducibility of science, but is also vital for innovation (e.g. for regulatory compliance).</p>
<p>Finally, 'System Deployment' captures the implementation and use of a model within a sociotechnical system. In the context of a scientific research project, this may include the application of the model to additional datasets to generate insights or knowledge. Whereas in the context of a commercial organisation, this could refer to a wide range of use cases (e.g., recommendation system for online bookings, predictive model for diagnoses in healthcare).</p>
<p>This macroscopic perspective is helpful as a heuristic, but the main benefits of this model for facilitating pubic engagement comes when we look at the lower-level stages.</p>

</table>
<p>As we will see shortly, the above framework helps establish a common reference point that can anchor reflection and deliberative activities related to public engagement.
The following illustrative example helps to demonstrate this point.</p>
<div class="admonition abstract">
<p class="admonition-title">Shaping Attitudes to Public Policy</p>
<p>A group of researchers working for a news organisation are carrying out a project to explore how the political attitudes of members of the public may be influenced by algorithmically generated articles.
One of their goals is to determine whether the emotional valence of an article affects the likelihood of the reader agreeing with or disagreeing with public policies that are being discussed by the news articles.</p>
<p>Using the AI project lifecycle model, they identify three initial stages and activities during their preliminary project planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stakeholder identification and engagement to support experimental design (Project Planning)</li>
<li>Participant data gathering and informed consent (Data Extraction or Procurement)</li>
<li>Experiment and participant feedback (Model Testing and Validation)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when they begin the initial stakeholder identification and engagement they hit a roadblock.
During discussion and deliberation with potential users of the news platform, the research team ask the participants to share their attitudes towards algorithmically generated content.
A majority of the participants have a critical attitude towards the use of AI to generate news contents, and express strong disapproval of the proposed idea of influencing attitudes towards public policies through what they see as "emotional manipulation".</p>
<p>On the basis of this feedback, the research team decide to change their research plan by co-designing an alternate system with the participants. The revised system still uses generative AI, but as a decision support for a human journalist. The team also add a further engagement activity during the <code>model documentation</code> stage to help mitigate any further aversion towards the system by ensuring sufficient public understanding and awareness of how the system operates.</p>
</div>
<p>We will reference this model and its constituent stages repeatedly as we continue through the remainder of the course.</p>
<h2 id="stakeholder-analysis">Stakeholder Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#stakeholder-analysis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of the type of engagement, a core part of any public engagement is knowing your audience.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Ask "who" before "how"!</p>
</div>
<p>This section will explore a three-step process, which begins with 'Project Planning' and is designed to help you identify and understand your audience (or, stakeholders), summarised in the following graphic.</p>
<p><img alt="Three steps of stakeholder analysis" src="../../../assets/images/graphics/stakeholder-analysis.png" width="75%" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Principle of Proportionality</p>
<p>The following steps are designed to be fairly exhaustive.
Therefore, it is important to recognise that they represent an ideal, which will need to be tailored to the specifics of a research and innovation project.
In short, some questions or forms of engagement/evidence gathering may not be required for particular research or innovation projects.
For example, a simple research project focusing on improving data literacy will not require the same types of extensive impact assessments as an innovation project developing a new safety critical AI system for use in healthcare.</p>

<h3 id="1-preliminary-project-scoping-and-stakeholder-analysis">1 Preliminary Project Scoping and Stakeholder Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#1-preliminary-project-scoping-and-stakeholder-analysis" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The first step occurs within the project team and involves a number of questions or self-assessments that help lay the groundwork for the remainder of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] outline key project components, including</li>
<li>[x] a high-level description of the ML/AI system being employed</li>
<li>[x] the domain or context of use</li>
<li>[x] the data to be used in the project (e.g. for model training)</li>
<li>[x] identify individuals or groups who may be affected by your project</li>
<li>[x] identify individuals or groups who may affect your project</li>
<li>[x] scope potential stakeholder impacts</li>
<li>[x] evaluate the salience and contextual characteristics of identified stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers and evidence accumulated from answering these questions will help your team with subsequent activities.</p>
<h3 id="2-positionality-reflection">2 Positionality Reflection<a class="headerlink" href="#2-positionality-reflection" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>All individual human beings come from unique places, experiences, and life contexts that have shaped their thinking and perspectives.
Reflecting on this variation can help us understand how our viewpoints might differ from those around us, and from those who have diverging cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and life experiences.</p>
<p>Social scientists have long referred to this kind of self-locating reflection as “positionality.”
When team members take their own positionalities into account, and make this explicit, they can better grasp how the influence of their respective social and cultural positions may affect the engagement process.
The following 'positionality matrix' is designed to help with this process:</p>
<p><img alt="Positionality matrix" src="../../../assets/images/graphics/positionality-matrix.png" width="75%" /></p>
<p>An example of how an individual's or group's characteristics may affect a research or innovation project is if a project team fail to identify how their own educational backgrounds enable them to understand and comprehend technical or complex concepts with comparative ease, or how the lack of cultural diversity in the team prevent them from recognising the significance of alternative values (e.g., prioritising technological policies that support social cohesion over individual autonomy). </p>
<h3 id="3-stakeholder-engagement-objectives-and-methods">3 Stakeholder Engagement Objectives and Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#3-stakeholder-engagement-objectives-and-methods" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The final step is to establish <em>engagement objectives</em> that enable the appropriate degree of stakeholder engagement and co-production in project evaluation, and <em>methods</em> that support the achievement of defined objectives. We will look at the latter of these in detail in the next section, so let's just address the former here.</p>
<p>If we think back to the first chapter, and the different models of participation (e.g., Arnstein's ladder of engagement)[@arnstein1969], then we can identify the following four goals that can help us specify our project's objectives:</p>
<p><img alt="Four engagement goals" src="../../../assets/images/graphics/engagement-goals.png" width="75%" /></p>
<p>The use of these goals to support the identification of engagement objectives should also be informed by a) the following variations on participation, and also b) the methods of participation available to you and those who you are engaging (see <a href="../how/">next chapter</a>)</p>
